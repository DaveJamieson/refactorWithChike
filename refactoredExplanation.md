Improvements Made:


Modularization:

*Extracted Functions: Functions calculatePerformanceAmount, calculateVolumeCredits, and formatAsUSD are extracted from the main statement function. This improves readability by breaking down complex logic into smaller, manageable pieces.

*Single Responsibility Principle: Each function now has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.


Error Handling:

*Error Throwing: Changed console.log for unknown play types to throw new Error. This makes the error more noticeable and ensures the program stops execution, making debugging easier.


Naming Conventions:

*Descriptive Function Names: Functions are given descriptive names that clearly state their purpose, improving code readability.


Reusability:

*Reusable Components: The functions calculatePerformanceAmount and calculateVolumeCredits can now be reused elsewhere in the code if needed.


Formatting:

*Helper Function: The currency formatting logic is moved to a helper function formatAsUSD, making the main statement function cleaner and separating concerns.


Benefits:

*Readability: The code is easier to read and understand due to modularization and descriptive names.

*Maintainability: Changes in one part of the logic (e.g., how performance amounts are calculated) can be made in one place without affecting the entire codebase.

*Extensibility: Adding new types of plays or changing the rules for volume credits is straightforward and localized to specific functions.

*Error Handling: More robust error handling helps in identifying issues early during the execution.
